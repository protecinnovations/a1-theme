redmine-a1-theme
================

Fork of Kirill Bezrukov's (kirbez@redminecrm.com) most
excellent A1 Theme for Redmine.

This Might Not Be The Theme You Are Looking For
-----------------------------------------------

This is a highly modified version of the A1-Theme which has been made for
Protec's own customised Redmine installation
(https://github.com/protecinnovations/redmine).

Chances are, unless you're running our version of Redmine you'd be better
off using the original version:
